# Liquidity: Financial trading emulator

ðŸ”´DISCLAMER: THE SCRIPT WRITTEN TO GRAB DATA FROM TRADING-VIEW IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. PEOPLE PAY ALOT OF MONEY FOR REAL-TIME FINANICAL PRICE FEEDS, DON'T USE
FOR COMMERICAL PURPOSES AND GET AN ACUTAL API.ðŸ”´


## Description
A web application project created with HTML, CSS, and Flask. This project emulates the functionality of a financial trading platform, offering users the ability to access live prices for various financial assets sourced from TradingView. 


## How To Run

1) Run pricegrabber.py in a seperate file (I haven't figured out/had the time to get the data and run the webapp in the same project.)

2) While pricegrabber.py is running, run app.py in the main project.

3) Everything should work as shown below
